## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Option 1: Install as Package (Recommended for Python Users)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/quillscribe/quillscribe.git
quillscribe
```

#### Option 2: Run from Source

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/quillscribe/quillscribe.git
    cd quillscribe
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```



## Setup Guide

### Option 1: OpenAI Whisper API (Recommended)

1.  Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2.  Open QuillScribe → Click **Settings**.
3.  In the **Whisper** tab, select **OpenAI Whisper API**.
4.  Enter your API key.
5.  Click **Save Settings**.

**Pros:** Fast, high-quality, works immediately.
**Cons:** Requires internet, may have usage costs.

### Option 2: Local `faster-whisper` Model

1.  Open QuillScribe → Click **Settings**.
2.  In the **Whisper** tab, select **Local Whisper.cpp (Private, works offline)**.
3.  Use the dropdowns to select a model category and a specific model. Smaller models are faster but less accurate.
4.  The application will handle downloading the model if it's not already present.
5.  Click **Save Settings**.

**Pros:** Private, works offline, no ongoing costs.
**Cons:** Requires model download, can be slower and less accurate than the API depending on the model and your hardware.

## Usage

1.  **Start Recording:** Click the microphone or use the global hotkey (`Win+F` by default on Windows).
2.  **Watch the Magic:** The microphone animates with a live audio waveform.
3.  **Stop Recording:** Click the microphone again or use the hotkey.
4.  **Get Results:** Text is automatically copied/pasted based on your settings.

### Output Modes

-   **Copy Only** - Copies transcription to the clipboard.
-   **Paste Only** - Pastes directly to the active application.
-   **Copy & Paste** - Does both.
-   **Display Only** - Shows text in the app without copying or pasting.

## Requirements

-   **Python 3.9+**
-   **Windows 10/11** (Primary target, with global hotkeys)
-   **Microphone** (Built-in or external)
-   **Internet connection** (For API mode and initial model downloads)

### Dependencies

-   `PySide6` - Modern Qt6 UI framework.
-   `sounddevice` - Real-time audio capture.
-   `numpy` - Audio processing.
-   `openai` - Whisper API integration.
-   `faster-whisper` - Efficient local Whisper model implementation.
-   `pyperclip` - Clipboard operations.

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Issues

-   **No microphone detected:** Check Windows microphone permissions. Ensure the microphone is connected and enabled. Use the "Refresh" and "Test" buttons in the Audio settings. Try the "Auto-select active microphone" feature.
-   **Poor audio quality:** Use the **Test** button in settings to check your audio levels. Reduce background noise and speak closer to the microphone.

### Transcription Issues

-   **API errors:** Verify your API key is correct and that you have a working internet connection.
-   **Local model issues:** Ensure you have enough disk space for the model download. If transcription is slow, try a smaller model (e.g., `tiny` or `base`).

## Development

### Running from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quillscribe/quillscribe.git
cd quillscribe
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

### Building Executable

QuillScribe uses **Nuitka** to build optimized native executables for superior runtime performance.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.9+** installed
2. **C Compiler** (Nuitka will auto-download MinGW64 if needed)

#### Build Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/quillscribe/quillscribe.git
   cd quillscribe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Nuitka build script:**
   ```powershell
   .\build_nuitka.ps1
   ```

   The script will:
   - Automatically download MinGW64 compiler (first run only, ~300MB)
   - Clean previous builds and caches
   - Compile QuillScribe to native code (takes 5-10 minutes on first build)
   - Create `QuillScribe.exe` and `QuillScribe-Installer.exe`

4. **Run the installer or executable:**
   - Use the installer: `QuillScribe-Installer.exe`
   - Or run directly: `QuillScribe.exe`

#### Build Notes

- **First build**: Takes 5-10 minutes as Nuitka downloads MinGW64 and compiles to C
- **Subsequent builds**: Faster due to caching (2-3 minutes)
- **Cache management**: The script automatically cleans Nuitka cache for clean rebuilds
- **Output**: `QuillScribe.exe` is a standalone executable with all dependencies bundled

#### Why Nuitka?

Nuitka was chosen over PyInstaller for several key advantages:
- **Better Performance**: Native compiled code runs 2-3x faster
- **Faster Startup**: No extraction to temp directory needed
- **Smaller Memory Footprint**: More efficient resource handling
- **Better Compatibility**: Handles complex dependencies like `faster-whisper` more reliably

**Required Data Files:**
- `src/quillscribe/icons/` - SVG and ICO icons for the UI
- `src/sounds/` - WAV files for recording notifications
- `src/quillscribe/app_logo.ico` - Application icon
